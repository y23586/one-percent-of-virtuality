Do you have a question whose answer you want to know by any means?
Zhritsa is an ultimate partner to solve such hard questions excellently.
Zhritsa is a high-performance smart speaker that can answer any questions, which is equipped with the latest 0R4CLE chip.
Zhritsa is very good at solving "decision problems" which can be answered with either YES or NO.

"Zhritsa, is the weather tomorrow in Tokyo sunny?"
"Zhritsa, am I free at 1:00 PM on Wednesday?"
"Zhritsa, is P not equal to NP?"
"Yes"
"No"

It can answer any questions with 100% accuracy.

To realize the smart speaker comfortable for users, firstly we aimed at making it "omniscient and omnipotent."
Because Zhritsa is equipped with the 0R4CLE chip developed with leading-edge virtual technology, it can always present the right answer for any questions.
Due to this, users can enjoy the experience as if they were in front of a god, which the other smart speakers cannot offer.

To impress Zhritsa's excellent functionality, we needed the design that is friendly, yet unfamiliar to users at all.
We adopted the design of the costume of "Miko" (Shrine maiden) in Japan into its appearance.
Since Miko had been assumed a role to tell the others oracles obtained by prayer, their image is coincident with Zhritsa's inviolable one.
