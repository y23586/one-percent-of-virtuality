0R4CLE/P, 0R4CLE/F
YOTSUMI CMOS Digital Integrated Circuit Silicon Monolithic
Synchronous Oracle with Reset

0R4CLE is an "Oracle" fabricated with silicon gate CMOS technology. It replies the solution for any decision problems in a finite time with ultra-low current consumption of less than 1 pA.
0R4CLE receives a decision problem encoded in its original format in UART/SPI/I2C and then outputs the solution for the problem via the OUT pin.
The serial input method is determined by combining MODE0 and MODE1. The internal state is completely initialized by setting the RESET pin to "L" level.

Features
・High speed: fmax = 1 GHz (typ.) at VCC = 5 V
・Low power dissipation: ICC = 1 pA (max) at Ta = 25 ℃
・Wide operating temperature range: Topr = 0 K (minimum), 5778 K (maximum)
・Interface: UART, SPI, I2C
・Can solve any decision problem in a finite time
・Can solve the halting problem of lower hierarchy by cascading
